Abstract:

One of the least under appreciated utilities in the Unix/Linux toolbox 
is the versatile 'make' program.   Since its inception by Stuart Feldmant 
@ Bell Labs in 1976, it has emerged as the preminent build orchestration
tool for many software and documentation projects although it is much more
powerful  than just something to compile your C source code. In this session,
we consider the usage of make itself and learn how to write and work with its
Makefile language. We will build a simple app using a Makefile and extend it
as our project is improved. Finally, we see an example document preparation
project using make and some other tools.
